Exceptions in Java:
    Exceptions are unwanted behaviors that occur during the runtime(when java application is running).
    In Exceptions Handling we write some kind of backup code to handle these runtime issues.
Why we should learn exceptions handling:
    If we don't handle exceptions it can lead to bad user experience which in turn leads
    to low profits and bad reputation for the company.
How we handle exceptions:
    we handle exceptions using below code blocks and keywords.
    try catch block finally block try catch finally throw and throws
Let's consider the below scenario:
    1) Read the data from an Excel file.
    2) Execute a loop to go through all the rows in an Excel file from Sheet1.
    3) open Syntax HRM Login page in GoogleChrome browser.
    4) Insert the data in the username and password field.
What are the things that can go wrong.
    Assumption I have tested this code very well on my computer and it works perfectly fine.
    No one has changed the code.
Issue #1:
    When Java program tries to read the file but gets a file not found exception.
Possible causes:
    1) Someone has deleted, moved or renamed the file to a different location
    2) File got corrupted because of the virus windows is not responding or there are
    not enough resources on my computer to read a file.
Issue #2:
    Someone like Oleg changed the sheet name in Sameer's Excel File.
Issue #3:
    Internet is down or website is not responding, or GoggleChrome is not installed
    or driver for GoogleChrome is not present any more in the specified location
Issue #4:
    Password of the application is changed an it is not updated in the Excel file etc.
