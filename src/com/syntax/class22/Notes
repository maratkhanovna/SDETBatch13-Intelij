what is methodOverriding:
    Happens when same method exists inside the parent class and the child class.
Why we should override a method:
    If wwe are inheriting from a Parent class and we don't like the implementation of a method
    from the parent class we can provide our own implementation.
    Sometimes it's done to improve the performance of code.
How we can override a method:
    when we inherit from a class we just need to rewrite that method inside the child class.
    all should be same except the body and access modifiers.
Rules:
    1) for overriding we must inherit from a class.
    2) the method in the parent class that we want to override must be exactly the same as
    method in  the child class, only the access modifiers can be different.
    3) the access modifiers in the parent class can only be increased with respect to the visibility
    we can only increase visibility of the parent method, from default to public for example
    we cannot decrease visibility of the parent class method, from default to private for example
    4) if something is not inherited we can't override it for example private methods and constructors.
