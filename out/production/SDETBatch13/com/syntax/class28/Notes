What is a List:
    List is an interface inside the collections' framework Which have below properties
    1) Insertion order is maintained.
    2) I can Store duplicate data.
List is implemented by many classes but we will be focusing on ArrayList and LinkedList:
ArrayList:
    when my requirement is that i will be reading the data a lot then i should be going
    with ArrayList.
LinkedList:
    Most of our operations will be writing the data to a list in between or in the start or shifting the
    data we should be going with LinkedList.
Iterator:
    is an interface that has three methods hasNext(), next(), and remove().
    whenever we try to modify the size of a list using simple loop there are chances that
    it will not work or will throw an error because lists are dynamic and can change the size at runtime
    so to be always on the safe side we should use Iterators.
 ===============================================================
Set:
1) Duplicates are not allowed
We will discussing three types of sets:
    1)HashSet 2) LinkedHashSet 3)TreeSet
HashSet:
    Upside: It is the fastest of all
    Downside: No insertion order is maintained
LinkedHashSet:
    Upside: Insertion order is maintained
    Downside: Retrieval of the element will be super slow
    insertion speed slower than HashSet, same as of Arrays.
TreeSet:
    Upside: Elements will always be in sorted form
    Downside: Insertion speed is slowest of all
    Retrieval speed better than linkedList but slower than HashSet.
==================================================================
Map:
Map is an interface in Java that allows us to store key value pairs
We can not have duplicate keys but we can have duplicate values
We will be discussing 3 of them:
1)HashMap
2)LinkedHashMap
3)TreeMap

HashMap:
    Upside:Fastest when it comes to insert and retrieve the elements
    Downside: No insertion order
LinkedHashMap:
    Upside: Insertion order will be maintained
    Downside: Retrieval will be slowest
TreeMap:
    Upside: Data will be stored in the sorted form based on key
    Downside: Insertion is the slowest
